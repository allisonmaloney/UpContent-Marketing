	<h2>Why there's content curation</h2>
	<p>Content marketing is the most prominent and effective form of marketing today. As a result, companies need to pump out content as quickly as possible to engage their audiences, join conversations and build authority. But finding so much to say all the time is extremely difficult to do, which is why there is content curation. Curation is taking something someone else has written, and then adding your own insight to it. But finding the right content to curate â€“ content that will engage and interest your audience - is time consuming, given the sheer amount of content that is published online each minute: 813, 894 pieces of content (2012). </p>

<div class="why">
	<h2>Why there's UpContent</h2>
	<p>UpContent was developed to make finding the right content for curation easy, quick and painless. Yes, there are several content curation tools on the market, but UpContent is much more unique. Its technology is based on the revolutionary algorithm that was developed for Rent Jungle, a leading, national apartment search engine that does for rental housing search what Kayak does for travel. The data mining and crawling technology is advanced and intelligent, so it is pulling a wide breadth of content and constantly finding new sources. Content comes from news sites, blogs, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.</p>

	<p>Community Elf, an online marketing and social media firm, was started by the founder of Rent Jungle. Now a separate firm, it is the company behind the growth and development of UpContent. With a deep understanding of the content and marketing world, and with key developers in hand, UpContent has become much more than a typical content curation tool. After years of R&D and internal use, Community Elf has added key filtering tools to the product, and is ready for its commercial release. </p>


	<p><strong>Multi-Factor Filtering Technology</strong><br />
	UpContent stands apart because of its multi-factor filtering technology. Instead of just returning as many relevant results as possible, it takes it 2 leaps further to actually deliver just the content you want to use for curation. The secret weapons are our proprietary Shareability and Influence algorithms that save you ample amounts of time and frustration.</p>
