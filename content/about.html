	<h2>Why There’s Content Curation</h2>
	<p>Content marketing is one of the most prominent and effective forms of marketing today (86% of B2C marketers and 91% of B2B marketers use content marketing). As a result, companies need to engage their target audiences through interesting, relevant content, join conversations and build authority - all at a high frequency. But creating all of this content from scratch and ensuring it is what your audience cares to hear, is extremely difficult to do - enter content curation. Curation is taking what someone else has written, and then adding your own insight to it. But finding the right content to curate – content that will engage and interest your audience - is time consuming, given that there is over 810,000 pieces of content published online each minute (2012). </p>

<div class="why">
	<h2>Why there's UpContent</h2>
	<p>UpContent was developed to make finding the right content for curation easy, quick and painless. Yes, there are several content curation tools on the market, but UpContent is much more unique. Its technology is based on a revolutionary algorithm that discovers and pulls content from news sites, blogs, social media sites, and from video postings; the technology is "always on," constantly crawling the web looking for and finding new sources. </p>

	<p><em>After years of R&D and internal use, Community Elf added key filtering tools to the product to shift the tool’s focus of finding content solely based on relevance, to those factors critical to thought leadership - recency, shareability, and influence. </em></p> 


	<p><strong>Multi-Factor Filtering Technology</strong><br />
	UpContent stands apart because of its multi-factor filtering technology. Instead of just returning as many relevant results as possible, it takes 2 leaps further to actually deliver just the content you want to use for curation. The secret weapons are our proprietary Shareability and Influence algorithms that save you time and the frustration of hunting through pages of search results.</p>
