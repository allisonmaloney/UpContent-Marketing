	<h2>How Does UpContent X-Ray Content?</h2>
	<p><strong>In 2012, it was discovered that 813,894 pieces of content are generated each minute. Each minute! And that was 3 years ago.</strong></p>

	<p>UpContent does what other curation tools do - it finds relevant information. But we decided to take it 2 steps further with advanced, specialized filtering (see section below) and intelligent content gathering (most tools don't take into account that corporate webpages and wiki articles don't power conversations; we've excluded these types of pages).</p>

<div class="why">
	<h2>UpContent is Fundamentally Different</h2>
	<p>UpContent is setting a new standard for content curation by using a multi-dimensional search and filter algorithm that has the capability to return just the content you need and actually want to post. A product of over 2 years of research and development, UpContent offers this unique blend of powerful filters:</p>

	<p class="relevance"><strong>Relevance</strong> - The content's level of importance/applicability to the matter being discussed<br />
	Content is analyzed based on the presence of keywords/key phrases related to the topic you created.</p>

	<p class="shareability"><strong>Shareability</strong> - The potential for the piece of content to be shared by an audience<br />
	Content is ranked using a complicated algorithm that scans the content headline and body, then scores it using tested psychological indicators that make a piece of content popular and shareable.</p>

	<p class="influence"><strong>Influence</strong> - The content author or outlet's ability to cause people to "pay attention" or modify behavior<br />
	The author and/or outlet are scored with a number of factors that take into account their popularity, online authority and subject matter expertise.</p>

	<p class="recency"><strong>Recency</strong> - Pertinence to the current state of the world<br />
	The world it is a changin', and so is the accuracy of content.  The more recent the content, the better.</p>
