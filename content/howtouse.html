	<h2>How to Use UpContent's Hootsuite Application</h2>
	<p>After adding the UpContent app as a stream to your Hootsuite account, you will see the UpContent tool's topic creation screen (Figure 1). </p>

	<h3>Creating a Topic</h3>
	<p>To create a topic, enter the name of the topic into the first open field. Then enter in keywords and key phrases that are relevant to the topic and your search. When you are finished entering search terms, click "Save" (Figure 2). For additional detail on how to craft your topic for great results, see <a href="/getthemost/" class="basic">How to get the most from UpContent</a>.</p>

	<em>NOTE: Once you select "Save," UpContent will begin scouring the web for your results.  If you do not see any results within 1 minute, use the Filter Options (described below) to toggle between Types.</em>

	<h3>Selecting Filter Options for Search Results</h3>
	<p>To view all filter options, click the funnel icon at the top right of the app's screen.</p>
	<p>UpContent offers 4 kinds of filtering options that each contain 2 or more choices. Click the down arrow on the respective field to view the choices. Once you make your selections, click "Apply" (Figure 3). When you apply changes, the search results will refresh to reflect the changes.</p>

	<h4>Deciphering the Filter Options</h4>
	<p><strong>Type:</strong> UpContent collects content from a large variety of source types. Use this filter to choose where you want your results to come from: news sources, blogs, video sites, or social media posts. Results are gathered for every type during each search (where available), but are only displayed for one source "type" at a time.<br />
	<em>Hint: If you want to view multiple source types at a time for a topic, add the UpContent stream to your dashboard multiple times. Each streaming window can be set for a different source type.</em>
	</p>

	<p><strong>Time:</strong> Select how far back you want content to be pulled from:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Day - last 24 hours</li>
		<li>Week - last 7 days</li>
		<li>Month - last 30 days</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Sort:</strong> Choose how you want your search results to be ordered:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Relevance - sorted by the content's level of importance/applicability to the matter being discussed</li>
		<li>Date (Recency) - sorted by pertinence to the current state of the world</li>
		<li>Influence - sorted by the influential status of the content author or outlet based on their/its ability to cause people to "pay attention" or modify behavior</li>
		<li>Shareability - sorted by each content piece's propensity to be shared by an audience</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Status:</strong> When reviewing search results, you have the capability to star, or favorite, pieces of content. Once you do this, they are placed in your "Saved" folder, which can be accessed through the "Status" filter. Filter content by "All" to see all search results, or filter by "Saved" to just see content pieces you have starred.</p>

	<h3>Reviewing and Managing Search Results</h3>
	<p>Once you create and save a topic, the topic's search results will be returned and visible in the tool's content reader. Results are displayed with the content piece's title, date found, text preview, image and URL (Figure 4).</p>

	<h3>Editing and Changing Topics</h3>
	<p>To change topics, add or delete keywords/phrases within a topic, or to add a new topic, click the name of your current topic at the top of the tool (Figure 5a).</p>
	<img src="/images/screencap_5.png" alt="Figure 5a: Select topic name to make changes.">
	<p>Once you click on the topic, a menu will open (Figure 5b).</p>
