	<p>Thank you for choosing UpContent. We are confident UpContent will succeed in saving you time and resources as it introduces you to a powerful new type of content search.</p>

	<p>UpContent stands apart from the everyday content curation tool by offering unique and advanced content filters that specialize in delivering the most shareable and influential content for your audience. UpContent was developed specifically for the marketer who needs the right content, at the right time to effectively interest and engage their audience, as well as for the knowledge leader who needs an efficient way to stay up-to-date with their industry and have discussion topics readily available.</p>
	
	<p><strong>UpContent is the tool you use to power, guide and lead conversations.</strong></p>

	<p>UpContent pulls content from the sources you need to be looking at when searching for content to share and curate; it crawls blogs, news sites, video sites, and social media.</p>

	<h3>UpContent's Unique Filters</h3>
	<p>UpContent created two unique filters for searching content, Shareability and Influence:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Shareability</strong> predicts and finds the content that has the best propensity to be shared by your audience, which is very valuable when driving customer engagement.</li> 
				<ul>
					<li><strong style="color: #775486;">How does it work?</strong> The shareability filter scans the titles and content body of articles searching for specific psychological indicators that indicate a piece of content is very shareable among an audience.</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>Influence</strong> serves you content that was produced by thought-leaders and the individuals/brands that people within an industry listen to. This is always great content to share and to consult when curating; plus, it can be a great way to discover new influencers within your industry to establish a relationship with. </li>
				<ul>
					<li><strong style="color: #775486;">How does it work?</strong> The influencer filter factors in multiple variables that determine how influential the author or outlet of the content piece is.</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>UpContent also offers the typical recency and relevancy filters:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Recency</strong> provides content that has pertinence to the current state of the world. The world is changing, and so is the accuracy of content - the more recent the content, the better.  </li>
			<li><strong>Relevance</strong> provides content based on its level of importance/applicability to the matter being discussed. Content is analyzed based on the presence of keywords/key phrases related to the topic created.</li>
		</ul>
