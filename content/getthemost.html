	<h2>How to Get the Most From UpContent</h2>
	<p>The power of UpContent is its ability to help you find the right content to power conversations and spark engagement among your audience.  To help ensure the results you receive are most aligned with the conversations you seek, here are a few tricks to help you get the best results from your topics:</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Why aren't results appearing immediately after creating a topic?
			</li>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Unlike a traditional search engine, UpContent was designed to scour the web to identify the right content to power conversations and spark engagement.  It takes approximately 1-3 minutes to provide results, which largely depends on the volume of suggestions available for your topic across each of the sources.  We recommend navigating to another task for a minute or two while your initial results load, or switching between "Types" using the filter icon (results may load faster for some sources).
					</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Problem:</strong> Limited search results returned.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Solution 1:</strong> Depending on the topic, it may not lend well to certain source types. If you do not receive many results for a specific content type, try the other sources using the Filter tool (     ).  In many cases, a topic may have poor results in one source (e.g. Social Media), but show exactly the conversations you wish to participate in another (e.g. Blogs or News).</li>
					<li><strong>Solution 2:</strong> Commonly, few results are returned because a topic may be too specific - it may contain too many keywords/phrases or overly narrow phrases. To broaden your search, try removing some of the phrases that are more granular (Editing and Changing Topic [link to part in how to use guide]).</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		<em>Note: When you edit a topic, the new topic criteria are saved for the next refresh (2x daily) of content. If you wish to see results for the newly created topic immediately, please create a new topic with the criteria. </em>
	</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Problem:</strong> Irrelevant results returned - an area of continuous improvement for the UpContent team. In some cases, the initial set of results shown do not appear to have much to do with the topic you created, or there are several irrelevant results scattered amongst the results list.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Solution:</strong>  A great hack to this issue is to change how the content is being sorted. For the best results, have the content sorted by Influence or Shareability, UpContent's two unique, advanced filtering options. This will allow you to view a different perspective of the results and may surface more of the content that meets your needs.  Also, be sure to switch between sources using the Type filter, as some topics may have more valid results in one medium vs. another.
					<p>To change how the content is sorted, navigate to the Filter menu by clicking on the Filter icon, then modify the Sort option to Influence or Shareability. </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Question:</strong> What is better: one long search phrase or many shorter search phrases/keywords?</li>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Answer:</strong> UpContent treats each search phrase as a single unit, and multiple search phrases are seen as independent items to be considered together.  This nuance is subtle, but can be powerful in fine-tuning your topic to receive the best results. </li>
				</ul>
		</ul> 
		<em>Note: If you enter in "dog" it will also return results for "dogs" - it is often unnecessary to enter in multiple forms of one word or phrase.</em>
